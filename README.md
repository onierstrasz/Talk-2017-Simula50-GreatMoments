# Talk-2017-Simula50-GreatMoments

This repo holds the [Keynote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(presentation_software)) slides for the talk "Great moments in the history of OOP" given at the [50 years anniversary of Simula celebration](http://simula67.at.ifi.uio.no/50years/) held in Oslo on September 26, 2017.

**Abstract:** Object-Oriented Programming has matured over the years from being an exotic (and oft-derided) programming paradigm to an established, successful (and oft-derided) cornerstone of modern software development. This talk will present a very personal tour of some of the milestones in the history of OOP, from its very beginnings to the present day.
